								<p>
									As of 26 March 2020, the number of confirmed cases of patients with IDOC-19 was 462,648
									worldwide [1]. The stability of health systems in many countries has been affected by the
									increasing need for Intensive Care Units (ICUs), especially the availability of mechanical
									ventilation devices for the care of patients with the most severe symptoms of the disease
									[2].
								</p>
								<p>
									Due to the high rate of infection of the virus, the models developed for the estimation and
									projection of hospital resources show an imminent overcoming of the attention capacities
									of the health services in intensive care, which on average happens 30 days after the
									beginning of the epidemic, depending on the installed capacities of each country [3]-[5].
									Similarly, it is concluded that there is no timely diagnosis of those critical patients due to
									the lack of tools for remote monitoring.
								</p>
								<p>
									The increase in the number of patients in hospitals is one of the variables that has generated
									a high incidence of mortality among those suffering from SARS-V2. This generates a possible
									spread of the virus within the same facilities because many developing countries do not
									have the sanitary conditions to isolate the virus within their own physical facilities. For this
									reason, the United States has opted for continuous monitoring, which allows for the total
									isolation of the patient [6]. However, this still requires a tool that physicians can use to
									monitor their patients in a controlled manner.
								</p>
								<p>
									In South Korea, for example, an application has been developed to monitor the symptoms
									of potential COVID-19 patients [7]. However, there are few applications that can effectively
									monitor the patient's physiological variables and generate a diagnosis with greater
									performance.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mobile applications are easily accessible and scalable, since most of the population has a
									Smartphone [8]. This has allowed many disruptive solutions, especially in the eHealth
									sector, to be based on wearable devices for the continuous monitoring of patients over long
									distances, such as smart bands or watches or even mobile phones. For example, for
									obstructive sleep-disrupting events in some patients [9].
								</p>
								<p>
									Mechanical ventilators are an indispensable element in the treatment of the disease. Given
									the experiences of countries such as Italy, Spain and recently the United States, a
									mechanical ventilator is often the only chance of survival for patients with severe symptoms
									and critical affects on the respiratory system (dyspnea and respiratory failure) [10].
								</p>
								<p>
									The emergency has caused the demand for ventilators to increase and the processes of
									production and acquisition of this equipment to become a priority. Many countries have
									implemented strategies for the production of alternative prototypes of mechanical
									ventilation, with the support of universities and the private sector. Such strategies help to
									cope with the high investments needed by hospitals and the increasingly difficult conditions
									for importing and exporting this type of equipment. [11]
